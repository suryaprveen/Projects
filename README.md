# Earthquake prediction 
•	Preprocessed geo-spatial earthquake data from the previous 60 years and constructed a model utilizing test-20 and train-80 datasets to predict future earthquake magnitude with 82% accuracy.
•	Visualized the predicted data using different plots like line chart, bar chart, map plot and doughnut chart.
